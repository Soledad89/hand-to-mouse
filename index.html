<h3><a name="intro-section" class="anchor" href="#intro-section"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>This project involves a joint collaboration between the Computer Science Department at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo and the Intel Corporation. Our project's collaborator from Intel Corp. provided the primary focus and objectives for this project which involves the use of basic web cameras to detect the gesture of throwing virtual objects on a computer. This focus requires the use of computer vision software in attempts to detect the generalized gestures of throwing.</p>

<h4><a name="overview-section" class="anchor" href="#overview-section"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Overview</h4>

<p>This project is a continuation form the <em>CSC 484 - Human Computer Interface</em> course offered the previous quarter. At which time, the project vision and scope were identified as utilizing a basic web camera in conjunction with the Java implementation of OpenCV, Open source Computer Vision library, to detect the essential hand gestures required for detecting a user’s throwing action. This action of throwing consists of the more general capability to accurately detect the gestures of open and closed hands. Once these two primary gestures can be accurately detected and traced, the application will map them to the mouse input device.</p>

<p>The gesture interface application will continue as the primary demonstration and testing platform of any future detection methods. Some reworking is required to allow for these other methods of gesture detection rather than only utilizing classifiers.</p>

<p>Based on the results from the previous quarters work, using Haar-like cascading classifiers proved unreliable for detecting open and closed hands. This contributed to the redirection of move active analysis and coding on our application side to test using skin tone detection, contour subtraction, and convexity defect detection, with the possibility of combining all of these techniques with classifiers for open and closed hands.</p>

<h3><a name="features-overview-section" class="anchor" href="#features-overview-section"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<p>For the end user of this application concept, this project entails the detection of their hand gestures and mapping them to interact with their computer system. These primary features include:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Hand Gesture Detection</dt>
    <dd>The ability to accurately detect an open or closed hand from the user’s web camera.</dd>
  <dt>Drag-and-Drop</dt>
    <dd>The drag-and-drop functionality based on the hand gesture detection (Feature 1) which also enables mapping of the hand gestures to the mouse input device.</dd>
  <dt>Throw Gesture Detection</dt>
    <dd>Implementation of the throw gesture relies on trajectory data computed from the drag and drop functionality (Feature 2). Thus, if an object on screen was dragged and let go with a velocity over some defined threshold, the object would then be thrown.
<p><em><strong><font color="red">Note:</color></strong> At this time, the specifics of what the thrown object would do are not defined.</em></p></dd>
  <dt>Gesture Interface Application</dt>
    <dd>The system tray application allows the user to utilize their own hands as the input device to interact with their computers. This application runs as a background system tray application on most platforms and provides the ability to turn on or off the mouse overrides. This software provides both the testing environment and the demonstration application of the other features.</dd>

<h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>
<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
