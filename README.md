Hand-to-Mouse (H2M)
===================

Project detects a users hand gestures of moving, grabbing, dragging, and dropping using a basic web camera. This implements the Java version of OpenCV and once these gestures can be recognized reliably, they will be mapped to the mouse input device.

This project involves a joint collaboration between the Computer Science Department at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo and the Intel Corporation. Our contact from Intel Corp., provides the primary focus and objectives for this project which involves the use of a basic web camera to detect the gesture of "throwing" virtual objects on a computer and/or mobile device. This focus requires the use of computer vision software to attempt to detect the generalized gestures of throwing.
